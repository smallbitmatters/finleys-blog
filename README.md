# finleys-blog
full-stack website using MERN

This is a full-stack react powered blog website with user authentication that I created for Finley, my daughter. 

What I used:
React: interactive front-end
Nodejs, Expressjs, Mongodb: backend
Firebase auth: user authentication
Google Cloud/Netlify: to host this fullstack site
